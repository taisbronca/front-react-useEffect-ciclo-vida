Front | React | useEffect

It's a mini-challenge where I practice using the useEffect hook, the order of component execution, and React's lifecycle methods.

Best practices:

- Carefully plan the componentization of the project;
- Follow the Figma layout;
- Create a modal that is populated with information about a shoe, which should be displayed when the shoe is clicked.
